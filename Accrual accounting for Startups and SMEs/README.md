<b>DESCRIPTION </b> <br>

<b> Sheet 1 - Transactions</b><br>
Items are to be manually added including Date, Description, Amount. Transaction Type
can be selected via an in-cell dropdown, which is sourced from the Transaction Type
tab. The selection is then assigned into the proper Debit/Credit accounts from
the Transaction Type tab. Column K should show if the entry has cash flow
implications, in which case the proper cash flow category has to be added -
"O", "I" or "F" in Column N. Do not enter any other values in column N. Keep
an eye out on the Consistency Checks.<br>

<b> Sheet 2 - Chart of Account</b><br>
Entries in Transactions are summed up here and assigned into the Credit/Debit
of the Account. Add, reduce, regroup Accounts for more or less granularity in
your Financial Statements.<br>

<b> Sheet 3 - LastPeriod</b><br>
If you have previous accounting period spreadsheets, add them here ensuring that
the Accounts reconcile between Sheet 2 and 3. The information from here will
be pulled into the Chart of Account in Columns J and K.<br>

<b> Sheet 4 - Transaction Type</b><br>
All the types of transactions you will be booking in your firm will be itemised
in column A (Add/remove entries as you need). The appropriate Debit / Credit
account is in the next 2 columns. Update the Consistency Checks as you go, since
it is easy to re-assign Debit / Credit accounts by accident.<br>

<b> Sheet 5 - Statements</b><br>
The Pivot tables for the Income Statement and Balance Sheet pull in data from
the Chart of Accounts tab, while the Cash Flow Statement is built using Entries
in Sheet 1. If you have multiple cash accounts, remember to select them all in
the Debit and Credit filter of the Cash Flow Statement.<br>

<b> Sheet 6 - Amortisation</b><br>
This sheet is not referenced anywhere else. You can build and break out your
net PP&E (Additions - Depreciaion - Disposals) per item here for up to 10 periods.<br>

<b> Sheet 7 - DCF - CGU </b><br>
This sheet is not referenced anywhere else. Should you have Accounts on your
Balance Sheet which you need to account for using a DCF as the present value of
their discounted future cash flows, you can build up these asset values here.<br>

<b> Sheet 8 -  Intercompany Lending</b><br>
This sheet is not referenced anywhere else. This can be used for Intercompany
lending, where columns C-E include the Lender's loan, capital and accrued
interest positions as per the Years (to) Maturity column. Columns H-J contain
the pro forma entries on the Borrower's debt account and capital account that is
to be reduced by non-cash interest expense to the Lender.
