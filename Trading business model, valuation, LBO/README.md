<b>DESCRIPTION </b> <br>
- Subject plan (”Plan A”) is for the (i) corporate structure, (ii) complete
debt/equity financing model, (iii) plans for exit of a back-to-back oil
products (gasoline, diesel) trading business relying on a short-term
corporate revolver and a receivables discounting facility for funding<br>
- The estimated requirement for the discounting facility is $50mm on
commitment with no recourse to the business and $6mm for a
general purpose corporate revoler
- Options presented for exit:

Turn-key sale to an investor who will scale and exit the
investment while the Founder keeps a minority share and
continues to run the business on a salary or

Founder keeps the business then liquidates after 5 years, as all
balance sheets assets are highly liquid
<br><br><br>
- To address the possibility of the Company not being able to secure a
funding facility due to limited track record and an unfavourable
commodities financing environment (Plan ”B”), is presented:
1. An initial $12mm equity investment is made into the Company to
be used as working capital and the Founder is hired as a Director
2. The Company divides the $12mm into $7.2mm preferred shares
paying 22% a share representing 60% ownership and 40% common
stock of $4.8mm
3. The Director receives 40% common stock while the Investor
retains the preferred shares which pay a fixed preferred dividend
of $1.6mm p.a. before taxes.
4. The earlier of: 6 years from the Investment or after a mandatory
10% IRR hurdle rate is met, the Founder has the option to buy out
the Investor’s share
